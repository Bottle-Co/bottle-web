              At Bottle&Co, we seek to unlock and fuel the possibility of a sustainable tomorrow.
              We are focused on the areas of greater needs, on the ways in which we can do the most good.
              With the alarming levels of environmental degradation, the planet needs a notch above caring,
              it needs definitive Action. Millions of plastic bottles enter the river-streams, oceans,
              landfills, etc. and deteriorate the eco-system for flora and fauna alike. Through Bottle&Co,
              we intend to drive that change to create a sustainable and greener tomorrow.

            <p className="btl-mission-description-body">
              We are the Worldâ€™s first sustainability-centric organization that facilitates
              multiple touchpoints with nature, to redress the unprecedented levels of environmental
              degradation. By 2022, we intend to retract and process 10 Million plastic pet bottles,
              and plant approximately 15K trees.

              Bottle&Co is the agent of change for the 21st century. We specialize in curating
              the most authentic and comfortable blend of fibers from recycled products (plastic bottles).
              Through our state-of-the-art process, which demands significantly fewer resources, we
              transform plastic bottles into recycled fiber. Not only do we recycle plastic, but also
              conserve electricity, save drinking water and emit fewer units of Carbon emissions,
              everytime we make a product. We use this process to create authentic, breathable and
              fashionable fabric for everyday use.
